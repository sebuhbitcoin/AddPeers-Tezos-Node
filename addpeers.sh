#          - Added some more check logic
#          - Added '>' prefix so you can tell who is outputting
#
# 20191025 - Filtering improvements @FreedomPrevails
#
# 20191019 - Babylon Update
# TZScan was the only public place to find a listing of all connected
# tezos nodes. With tzscan offline, this information is no longer
# accessible. The script below will still attempt to maintain connections
# to the foundation nodes.

# The tezos-admin-client binary will output 'Error' messages in
# most cases, even when already connected to a peer.
#
# If you found this script helpful, send us a tip!
